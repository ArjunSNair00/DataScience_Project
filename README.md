This project aims to do build a job recommendation system using K-NN algorithm and do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a jobs dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/princekhunt19/700-jobs-data-of-ai-and-data-fields-2025 . The dataset contains attributes like Position Name, Company,Location,Company Rating,Job Type,Salary,External Application Links,Full Job Descriptions.

The user can input skills (via prompts or checkboxes), preferred salary range,job role, location. the system will recommend jobs ranked by compatibility and show match score, highlighting matched and missed skills of each category. Also predict the salary based on new skills combination.

We hope to make a web interface using streamlit in future to make it easier to use. This project was chosen to help students find jobs to match their skills and interests.
